# QuidditchSimulator2k17

This is a project to create a web-based game that is a simulation of Quidditch. Quidditch is a sport from Harry Potter that is also played
in real life at different universities, such as the College of Charleston. This game will be created using the USQ rulebook, but will feature
magical aspects and be more similar to the way the game is run in the books/movie. Kind of a blending of both worlds.
